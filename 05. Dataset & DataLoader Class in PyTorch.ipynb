First Batch Returned to Main Process:\n","* Whichever worker finishes first sends its fully prepared batch (e.g., batch 1) back to the main process.\n","* As soon as the main process gets this first prepared batch, it yields it to your training loop, so your code for batch_data, batch_labels in dataloader:receives (batch_data, batch_labels) for the first batch.\n","\n","4. Model Training on the Main Process:\n","* While you are now performing the forward pass, computing loss, and doing backpropagation on the first batch, the other three workers are still preparing their batches in parallel.\n","* By the time you finish updating your model parameters for the first batch, the DataLoader likely has the second, third, or even more batches ready to go (depending on processing speed and hardware).\n","\n","5.
